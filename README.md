# Network Algorithms Visualization

Built for Professor Bhaskar Krishnamachari at the Center For Cyber Physical Systems to demonstrate Djikstra's Algorithm routing in cellular networks modeled by a [random geometric graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_geometric_graph) and [ETX link strengths](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352864816301419).

Uses the D3 library and ES6 javascript data structures. Feel free to play around, generate a graph, and run the algorithm!
